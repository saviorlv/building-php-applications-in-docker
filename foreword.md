# Foreword

## About the Book

Docker has quickly become the container engine of choice, and it may be replacing a virtual machine near you soon. This book offers a step-by-step guide to walk you through building your first real PHP web application using Docker while explaining the basics of the platform along the way.

The application we build in this eBook will do many of the key things web developers need to do on a daily basis, including:

- Installing dependencies using Composer.
- Getting data from a third-party API.
- Saving data to a MySQL database.
- Using a web framework (SlimPHP) for routing.
- Storing environmental variables securely.
- And much more.
