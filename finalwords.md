# Final Words

I hope that reading and working through this book has piqued your interest in Docker and given you the confidence to start using it regularly for local development. I have found that the best way for me to learn something new is to just start building things, and Docker has been no different. When I decided that Docker was how I would build PHP apps, I uninstalled my virtual machine and went all-in. While you may not be ready to do that just yet, forcing yourself to solve problems with Docker will make you get better at it.

Finally, if you have feedback for this book, questions for me, or you're interested in PHP or Docker books or training, my contact information is available at [shiphp.com](https://www.shiphp.com/). Thanks for reading!
